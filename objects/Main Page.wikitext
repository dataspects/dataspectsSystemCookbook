* a [http://localhost:20107/search search engine] that can [https://dataspects.com/dataspects-search index any kind of information source]
* a '''wiki''' used as the primary platform to '''manage knowledge as connected entities''' organized by the principles of [https://everypageispageone.com/the-book/ Every Page is Page One]

== How this cookbook is organized ==

Every piece of knowledge (regarding orientation, understanding, subjects, workflows and procedures) is of a distinct {{DomainTerm|Entity Types|dataspects}}. See [[C180913155815]].

{{EntitiesByEntityType}}

These entity types are managed by dedicated [[Ontology Components]].

dataspects Docker images provide system components at a level of abstraction that

* maximizes domain agnosticity
* customizes the component by
** --env (e.g. HTTP Server ports)
** --volume (e.g. Apache Virtual Host files)
* allows for developing the component by overlaying container-internal software repositories with corresponding Docker-host software repositories by means of --volume
