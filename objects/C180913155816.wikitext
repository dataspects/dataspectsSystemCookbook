== Story ==

* [[Component 518024]], [[Component0945587209]]
* Queries return score
* Filtered queries match or do no match
* Construct {{DomainTerm|Search Requests|Elastic}} as queries in combination with filter(s)
** Search requests are sent to a {{DomainTerm|Node|Elastic}}, which sends it to all primary and replica shards for the index(es) being queried and returns sorted and ranked search results
** Default {{DomainTerm|Search Routing|Elastic}} is "query_then_fetch"
** {{DomainTerm|Search Request Scope|Elastic}} can be specified: indices, types, {{DomainTerm|Index Aliases|Elastic}} (for searching multiple indexes)
** Components:
*** query (search for docs containing "xyz" limited to docs having e.g. status=active)
*** size
*** from
*** _source (configure this to filter fields to be returned, if no stored field has been defined in mapping then the field is returned from _source, _source filtering is cheaper than using stored fields)
*** sort
* The {{DomainTerm|Search API|Elastic}} implements the {{DomainTerm|Query DSL|Elastic}} and the {{DomainTerm|Filter DSL|Elastic}}
