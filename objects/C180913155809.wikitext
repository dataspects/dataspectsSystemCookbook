|HasEntityTitle=Controlled, faceted, multilateral, asynchronous, bidirectional synchronisation of multiple SMWs (CFMABS)
}}

== CFMABS Idea and Rationale ==

We want to share terminological and assertional content between SMWs like this:

# '''Controlled'''
# '''Faceted'''
# '''Multilateral''' (between more than 2 SMWs)
# '''Asynchronous''' (content exchange can happen at any time in any order)
# '''Bidirectional''' (no such thing as "master" SMWs)
# '''Synchronisation'''

in a way that is:

# conscient
# repeatable/idempotent
# reusable
# reversible/rollback
# comprehensible/logged
# supporting error recovery

== Separation of concerns ==

# SMW content is smartly exported/imported to/from text files into/from a folder by the dataspects app.
#* Smart means that the SMWs, folders and pages (wikitext and metadata) involved remember all the information necessary to implement above mentioned "conscient, repeatable/idempotent, reusable, reversible, comprehensible/logged, supporting error recovery".
# That folder is then put under [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_version_control_software version control].
